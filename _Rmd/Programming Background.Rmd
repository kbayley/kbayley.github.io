## Programming Background

I haven't had as much programming experience as perhaps my classmates have. The bulk of my experience has been learning R in an ad hoc way by attending workshops through UNC's Research Hub prior to taking this class. I do like that R is relatively easy to get started with - you can get set up with it relatively quickly and start seeing the results of your efforts.

Since I don't have a technical background, the learning curve beyond those initial basics has been quite steep. But I appreciate that this course is forcing me to dive deeper and get more comfortable. I hope that learning other languages in the future is a bit easier now that I'm putting in the work to learn R more thoroughly.
