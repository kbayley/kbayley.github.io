title: ST 558 - Project 1
---
This project was a good exercise in applying all of the information we've learned so far in the course, and helped me really dig into pulling data to query, manipulate, and work with. If I've been able to keep up with the homework assignments, it's because we were recreating something that already existed, so there was a model to work from. With this project, the independence was a little intimidating, but interesting to be able to explore the process thoroughly on my own.

I think next time, it'd be helpful to work with data that I'm really familiar with and know how I want to analyze from the beginning. Understanding the existing structure of your data and knowing exactly what you're looking for will help build the analysis from the beginning. This may not always be possible, but I always write better papers when I know where it's headed and have an outline!
