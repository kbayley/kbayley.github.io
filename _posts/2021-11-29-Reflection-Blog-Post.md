I don't think much has changed about what I think a data scientist is or what they do as a result of taking this course, but I know that I have learned a ton this semester and can apply much of it to my current work immediately. As far as I can tell, using data science in education and workforce topics is relatively new, so I'm excited to begin applying many of these concepts and utilizing these skills going forward.

Because R was the first tool I learned for data science, I definitely intend to keep using it unless I begin work with an organization that's already established with a different tool. It's hard to beat free and open access, and the portability of projects is also really helpful.

This course was pretty difficult and often frustrating for me, but it forced me to dive in and really learn the ins and outs of using R the way I needed to. Obviously I still have plenty more to learn, but now that I have this foundational knowledge, I can take it in a lot of different exciting directions.
