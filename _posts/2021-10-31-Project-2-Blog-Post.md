# Project 2 Review

For this project, my partner and I worked together to analyze a dataset relating to the popularity of online news articles from Mashable, as measured by the number of shares each article received. After a bit of exploratory data analysis, we determined the most significant variables in the dataset and subset the data to work only with those variables, as well as only working with the Lifestyle topic of articles to start. We made a few plots and tables to review some aspects of the data, and then built a total of four models to find the best model fit to predict the number of shares an article would receive based on the significant variables. We compared two linear regression models as well as a random forest and a boosted tree model. After splitting the data into a training and test set, comparing all four models with the training data, the boosted tree model appeared to be the best fit due to the lowest RMSE (5627.462). We then automated this process to repeat for each of the other topics in the data (Business, Social Media, Entertainment, etc.)

We ran into some trouble with subsetting the data that resulted in our random forest model taking a significant amount of time to run. After clarifying the subsetting, we were able to make faster progress. The automation step and making sure everything made it to github in the proper format was also a bit of a struggle. This project was helpful in putting several of the concepts we've learned recently together, the way you might in an analysis of any kind of data you're working with. If I were to do this project again, I would love to work with a dataset that incorporates information from my field, so that I might be able to directly apply this knowledge to my work in education and workforce research.
