I am new to the world of data science and statistics, so my responses are based on a bit of my own exploration and cursory knowledge along with the assigned articles. Data science appears to me to be about the real-world application of statistics through the use of computer programming. As such, the field exists at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and a specific industry or content area of expertise. It requires enough computer science to manipulate and analyze data, enough statistics to understand the principles and mechanisms for that analysis, as well as enough content knowledge to understand what indicators you’re using and how that might make a difference to the decision-makers (including yourself, as the case may be). 

Data scientists appear to live in a more practical, real-life application world, versus the more theoretical and experimental world of statisticians. Both require the ability to work with and analyze data, but the use and application of their work is where they seem to diverge. The overlap between the fields seems obvious, but the goals and end use of that overlap varies. 

I’m coming at data science from a background in higher education and career development, hoping to move into a role that focuses on larger scale education and labor/workforce policy issues. For example, I might look at the IPEDS dataset and want to determine how transferring from a community college to a four-year institution affects graduation rates, salary outcomes, and student debt loads. I have the content expertise to know what to look for and what questions I might want to ask, and am working on building the skills to be able to work on answering those questions.
